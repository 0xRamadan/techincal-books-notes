# Chapter 01: A pragmatic Philosophy

    Learning is a continuous and ongoing process.

## 01.1: The Cate Ate My Source Code.

_"The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of appearing weak."_ _**J. B. Bossuet**_

- ### Take Responsibility
  > Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses.

## 01.2: Software Entropy

- ### Don’t Live with Broken Windows.

## 01.3: Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

- ### Be a Catalyst for Change.
- ### Remember the Big Picture

## 01.4: Good-Enough Software

Involve your users in the trade-off

- ### Make Quality a requirements issue.
- ### Know when to stop.

It is equally unprofessional to promise impossible time scales and to cut basic engineering corners to meet a deadline.

Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow.

## 01.5: Your Knowledge Portfolio

_"An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest."_
_**Benjamin Franklin**_

> Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets.

> Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed.

**Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio:**

1. Serious Investors invest regularly – as a habit.
2. Diversification is the key to long-term success. The more different things you know, the more valuable you are.
3. Balance between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket.
4. Buy low and sell high for maximum return.
5. Review and re-balance periodically.

**Goals**:

- Learn at least one new language every year.
- Read a technical book each quarter.
- Read nontechnical books, too. Don’t forget the human side of the equation.
- Take classes.
- Participate in local user groups. Isolation can be deadly to your career.
- Experiment with different environment.
- Stay current
- Get wired. Newsgroups are a great way to find out what experiences other people are having with it.

> The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things.

> Always have something to read in an otherwise dead moment.

> Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear.

> Never underestimate the power of commercialism. Just because a web search engine lists a hit first doesn’t mean that it’s the best match.

**Care and Cultivation of Gurus**

- Know exactly what you want to ask, and be as specific as you can be.
- Frame your question carefully and politely.
- After you’ve framed your question, Stop and look again for the answer.

- Sit back and be patient. People are busy, and it may take days to get a specific answer.
- Be sure to thank anyone who responds to you.

## 01.6: Communicate!

A large part of our day is spent communicating, so we need to do it well.
Summary

- Know what you want to say.
- Know your audience.
- Choose your moment.
- Choose a style.
- Make it look good.
- Involve your audience.
  - Get their feedback, and pick their brains.
- Be a listener.
  - Encourage people to talk by asking questions or have them summarize what you tell them.
- Get back to people.
  - Keeping people informed makes them far more forgiving of the occasional slip and makes them feel that you haven’t forgotten them.
    > It’s Both What You Say and the Way You Say it.

**The **WISDOM** acrostic—Understanding an audience**

- What do you want them to learn?
- What is their interest in what you’ve got to say?
- How sophisticated are they?
- How much detail do they want?
- Whom do you want to own the information?
- How can you motivate them to listen to you?
